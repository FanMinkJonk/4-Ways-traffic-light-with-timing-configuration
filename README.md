The final product is on Ex10 branch.

At first, I was not used to working with github, so I ended up creating multiple branches for each exercises and it caused a lot of problems for me. For example, when I want to use the code in a specific exercise that I already implemented, I copy that file and paste it into the current working directory, which is extremely amateur.
I think that I have improved alot recently and have understanded the work flow of git.
